## Overview 💭

The "Product Last Order" module is an extension for Magento 2 developed by Discorgento that generates a personalized message to the customer when they access a product that has been previously purchased. The message informs the customer that they have already bought this item and also displays the date of the purchase. Additionally, the module adds a "Order Details" link that, when clicked, redirects the customer to the corresponding Order Details page, providing all the details of the accessed order.

## Features 🧩

- Generates a personalized message for products previously purchased by the customer.
- Displays the date of the product purchase.
- Adds an "Order Details" link to redirect the customer to the Order Details page.

## System Requirements ⚙️

Make sure your Magento 2 installation meets the following requirements:

- Magento 2.x
- PHP 8.x
- Composer

## Installation 🔧

You can install the "Product Last Order" module via Composer. To do this, execute the following commands in the terminal:
